This is my Tournament_scheduler application where I have used child component to represent the form that is getting input and also representing the output with date and combinations based on teams per day input.

app.component.html is used for representing the output and combination while clicking on view button.

While clicking on view schedule button, date with combinations will display.

Both of the operation involves different APIs.
